    <p class="bold">CSS will display overflow in this way, because to do something else could cause data loss. In CSS data loss means that some of your content vanishes. So the initial value of overflow is visible, and we can see the overflowing text. It is generally better to be able to see overflow, even if it is messy. If things were to disappear or be cropped as would happen if overflow was set to hidden you might not spot it when previewing your site. Messy overflow is at least easy to spot, and in the worst case, your visitor will be able to see and read the content even if it looks a bit strange. </p>
