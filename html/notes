we generally use iframe to embed outer content eg. other websites, youTube videos, etc

We don,t use iframes to embed our own webpge into another as it is costlier as iframe downloads whole webpage, it's like opening new tab everytime 
for own webpage we prefer to use lib like React, Vue


Media.html files :-
if we change just one para width/height the other will change such that the aspect parameter is maintained. However if we chnage both then image will chnage acc. and aspect ratio will not be retined -->
alt in image is useful when image is not displayed or for blind people


<!-- Ctrl + Shift + r= hard refresh, pre-downloaded content gets removed from browser -->

<!--  video and Audio parameters :-
    
    controls: To give controls to audio/video
    autoplay: to play automatically when page loads , modern browzers disable autoplay by default
    preload: what data when we loaded as soon as page loads, 
            auto: means all, 
            metadata: only thumbnail & length of video, 
            none: not even metadata is downloaded
    loop: to let video play again once it's finished        

    poster: Tells the defaul thumbnail of the video, has link to the thumbnail pic
    loop : A Boolean attribute; if specified, the browser will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video.
    
    The content inside the opening and closing <video></video> tags is shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.
